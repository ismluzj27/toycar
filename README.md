James was the front-end developer, expanding from the home page and adding a rich variety of pages with interactive links, smooth and responsive UI—all to create a final product. To achieve this, lots of tweaking and style classes were added in the cascading style sheet to achieve the final goal of clean, responsive UI. He worked effectively with Bootstrap framework to create a plethora of html elements and even included some modularity, all that fit into the layout of the website and contribute to a rich user content experience.

David is more focused on back-end processes, set up the Django project (like URL patterns, views.py, etc.) and performed troubleshooting with things like PyCharm project setup, Github repository and project runtime errors. He set up the initial skeleton of HTML templates and implemented functions like the Google account integration, ensuring the front end interfaces with the back end effectively and preparing the way for the project to have more features. He also worked on the themed CSS styling. 

Paco was the creative visionary and provided the team with a variety of his own model car collection. He outlined the seed of our idea that sprouted to become the project it is now, and the progress it will go towards.

Sef handled a map of all the pages of the website, deciding where each page should go and the function of every webpage, making sure there is no unneeded URLs while also . He also worked on UI aesthetics, making a pleasing, contrasting color scheme.
